#why did we create so many characters?!?!?!
#we can always chop it down a bit
#no weve committed to it now lol
#full send from here
# yeah 
#i finnished the descriptions what should i start on next? the actuall character?
#either start with the actual characters in main code or try to start how we set up fights
#i should learn the class thing then try and crate the actual character before we create the other stuff
#lets do it like that then. When we meet up you can teach me
#sounds good. You might want to read the descriptions it might help with some ideas for dialogue. 
#Will do
#I live in a constant state of fear and misery.
